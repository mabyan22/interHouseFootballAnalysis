# interHouseFootballAnalysis
This is a project that involves data analysis on the grassroots level to attempt to reveal the true benefits of using data in sports, and as an extension, in other fields. These are radar charts that visualise the performances of each player (whose names have been hidden for privacy) and provide an unbiased view of their performance. The data was collected during inter-house football games at a high school. The program uses Python - the pandas, matplotlib and the soccerplots libraries are most significant. The scope for analysing games in such a way is immense as when competitions are held this can lead to a significant advantage over other teams as the strengths of a team using data can be maximised and tailored to neutralise the opponent.
